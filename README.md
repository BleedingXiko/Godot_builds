# Godot_builds

Godot voxel is using godot 3.5.1 and voxel_tools 3.x by Zylann


Godot dgb is using godot 3.5.1 and godot_dragonbones by mauville-technologies


if you want to combine these two then transfer the voxel module in godot_voxels to the dragon bones godot module folder, not the other way around.
